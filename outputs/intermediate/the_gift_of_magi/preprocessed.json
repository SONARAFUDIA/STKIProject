  "raw_text": "One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it\nwas in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the\ngrocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one’s cheeks burned\nwith the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing\nimplied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven\ncents. And the next day would be Christmas.\n\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little\ncouch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection\nthat life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles\npredominating.\n\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first\nstage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8\nper week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had\nthat word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\n\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go,\nand an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring.\nAlso appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name “Mr. James\nDillingham Young.”\n\nThe “Dillingham” had been flung to the breeze during a former period of\nprosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when\nthe income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of\ncontracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James\nDillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called\n“Jim” and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already\nintroduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\n\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag.\nShe stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a\ngray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she\nhad only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving\nevery penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a\nweek doesn’t go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated.\nThey always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a\nhappy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something\nfine and rare and sterling—something just a little bit near to being\nworthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.\n\nThere was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you\nhave seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person\nmay, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal\nstrips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being\nslender, had mastered the art.\n\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her\neyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within\ntwenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its\nfull length.\n\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which\nthey both took a mighty pride. One was Jim’s gold watch that had been\nhis father’s and his grandfather’s. The other was Della’s hair. Had the\nqueen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have\nlet her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her\nMajesty’s jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all\nhis treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his\nwatch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from\nenvy.\n\nSo now Della’s beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like\na cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself\nalmost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and\nquickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or\ntwo splashed on the worn red carpet.\n\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl\nof skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she\nfluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.\n\nWhere she stopped the sign read: “Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All\nKinds.” One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting.\nMadame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the “Sofronie.”\n\n“Will you buy my hair?” asked Della.\n\n“I buy hair,” said Madame. “Take yer hat off and let’s have a sight at\nthe looks of it.”\n\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\n\n“Twenty dollars,” said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\n\n“Give it to me quick,” said Della.\n\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed\nmetaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim’s present.\n\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else.\nThere was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all\nof them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in\ndesign, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by\nmeretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do. It was even\nworthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be\nJim’s. It was like him. Quietness and value—the description applied to\nboth. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried\nhome with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be\nproperly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was,\nhe sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather\nstrap that he used in place of a chain.\n\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence\nand reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went\nto work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which\nis always a tremendous task, dear friends—a mammoth task.\n\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls\nthat made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at\nher reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\n\n“If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself, “before he takes a\nsecond look at me, he’ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl.\nBut what could I do—oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven\ncents?”\n\nAt 7 o’clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of\nthe stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\n\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on\nthe corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she\nheard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she\nturned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying a little\nsilent prayer about the simplest everyday things, and now she\nwhispered: “Please God, make him think I am still pretty.”\n\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and\nvery serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two—and to be burdened\nwith a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\n\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of\nquail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in\nthem that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger,\nnor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments\nthat she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with\nthat peculiar expression on his face.\n\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\n\n“Jim, darling,” she cried, “don’t look at me that way. I had my hair\ncut off and sold because I couldn’t have lived through Christmas\nwithout giving you a present. It’ll grow out again—you won’t mind, will\nyou? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say ‘Merry\nChristmas!’ Jim, and let’s be happy. You don’t know what a nice—what a\nbeautiful, nice gift I’ve got for you.”\n\n“You’ve cut off your hair?” asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not\narrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.\n\n“Cut it off and sold it,” said Della. “Don’t you like me just as well,\nanyhow? I’m me without my hair, ain’t I?”\n\nJim looked about the room curiously.\n\n“You say your hair is gone?” he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\n\n“You needn’t look for it,” said Della. “It’s sold, I tell you—sold and\ngone, too. It’s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you.\nMaybe the hairs of my head were numbered,” she went on with sudden\nserious sweetness, “but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall\nI put the chops on, Jim?”\n\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della.\nFor ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some\ninconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or\na million a year—what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would\ngive you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that\nwas not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\n\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the\ntable.\n\n“Don’t make any mistake, Dell,” he said, “about me. I don’t think\nthere’s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that\ncould make me like my girl any less. But if you’ll unwrap that package\nyou may see why you had me going a while at first.”\n\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an\necstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to\nhysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of\nall the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\n\nFor there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back, that Della had\nworshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise\nshell, with jewelled rims—just the shade to wear in the beautiful\nvanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had\nsimply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of\npossession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have\nadorned the coveted adornments were gone.\n\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up\nwith dim eyes and a smile and say: “My hair grows so fast, Jim!”\n\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, “Oh, oh!”\n\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him\neagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash\nwith a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\n\n“Isn’t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You’ll have\nto look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I\nwant to see how it looks on it.”\n\nInstead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands\nunder the back of his head and smiled.\n\n“Dell,” said he, “let’s put our Christmas presents away and keep ’em a\nwhile. They’re too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get\nthe money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on.”\n\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—who brought\ngifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving\nChristmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones,\npossibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And\nhere I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two\nfoolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other\nthe greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise\nof these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were\nthe wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest.\nEverywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.\n",
